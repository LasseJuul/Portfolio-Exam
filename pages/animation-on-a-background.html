                Animation on a background </h1>
            <p>
                The goal was to design my own character and later on animate it as a sprite and add a background to it. Before starting the animation process i'd made a moodboard to draw inspiration from and a written analyses of how I were to use it.

                The assignment pointed out how much work there goes into the creation of animation. Getting all the movements right when trying to make your character look realistic is a challenge, and I had to draw from my knowledge of animation principles, mostly follow through as my character is walking.

            <h2>What i've learned</h2>
            <p>
                Most obvious is that i've learned to animate a sprite. It wasn't perfect as the walk cycle is a little bit off, missing a frame or two, even with my sketches showing the steps i needed. I did catch the essence of what its like to animate, and it's extremely time consuming.
                <br>I had worked with character design before but set my expectations to high in the beginning, wanting to make a leaf with tons of colors in addition to having the background and character change colors throughout the cycles to mimic the seasons changeing. I did learn to be more realistic but also added skills in character design, sketching, character development, background design and how to actually code it with css, adding keyframes to the repertoire.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to keyframes i also learned the animation feature of css. This was used to make the background cycle itself over and over, meanwhile the walking animation would run - creating the illusion of my little leaf walking.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working on the background was interesting aswell. Here it was important to add different shapes of colors to enhance the depth of the image to make it more appealing.
