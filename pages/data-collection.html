                Data collection was the first module of theme 3 Basic UX. The assignment revolved around collecting different types of data and then later on process and present them.

            <p>
                The first tasks was all about collecting the data types we needed - desktop, observation, inteviwe and survey research. After collecting it was time to process using methods depending on which research type was in question. Finally it was to be presented, stripping it down to the core for easy understading.

            <p>
                Overall the project taught me how to value and differenciate between certain types of data. Being able to choose the right format is extremely important as they all have individual values, both benefitial and non-benefitial.
                <br>
                <br> Furthermore it showed me how preparation is key and making proper usefull reserach may not sound so difficult, but if it's to be used with a certain goal in mind, you have to truly get to the core and ask the right questions.
                <br> In the end when all the data has been gathered it's also vital to present only what is relevant, theres no need to be overloaded with unnessecary data even though you may have it.
