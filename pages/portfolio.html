            <p>
                Data collection was the first module of theme 3 Basic UX. The assignment revolved around collecting different types of data and then later on process and present them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first tasks was all about collecting the data types we needed - desktop, observation, inteviwe and survey research. After collecting it was time to process using methods depending on which research type was in question. Finally it was to be presented, stripping it down to the core for easy understading.

            <p>
                The prototype project was a group project focused on researching and developing a prototype of what a website would look like. It had a very specific sender and target audience in mind with the Danish government and international students.</p>
            <p> I had the resonsibility of researching accommodation websites and building the prototype in Adobe XD from sketches and inserting the content, aswell as making a style tile and conducting the "Think aloud test". The experience of working in XD was really rewarding, expecially when going from a low-fidelity prototype to a high-fidelity and seeing it take more and more shape.

            <p>
                Design sprint was a big group project with the goal of creating a native app concept. The subject for the app was help student life and we had total freedom in what direction we wanted to take this. We had 5 days to, map, sketch, decide, prototype and pitch our idea.
            </p>
            <p>
                During these 5 days of intense developing i had multiple responsibilities within the project. Collectively we narrowed it down to an idea of creating an app for the different student driven organizations at KEA, we called this app KEAp Up.

            </h1>
            <p>
                The goal was to design my own character and later on animate it as a sprite and add a background to it. Before starting the animation process i'd made a moodboard to draw inspiration from and a written analyses of how I were to use it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The assignment pointed out how much work there goes into the creation of animation. Getting all the movements right when trying to make your character look realistic is a challenge, and I had to draw from my knowledge of animation principles, mostly follow through as my character is walking.
