                The prototype project was a group project focused on researching and developing a prototype of what a website would look like. It had a very specific sender and target audience in mind with the Danish government and international students.</p>
            <p><br> I had the resonsibility of researching accommodation websites and building the prototype in Adobe XD from sketches and inserting the content, aswell as making a style tile and conducting the "Think aloud test". The experience of working in XD was really rewarding, expecially when going from a low-fidelity prototype to a high-fidelity and seeing it take more and more shape.

            <h2>What i've learned</h2>
            <p>
                Mostly what i took with me from this project was skills in XD. The software is extremely usefull to help visuallize and prepare before coding, and by making a low-fidelity. Also it taught me to always keep in mind where to place content regarding the purpose of the website. By having a mental map you make a superior user expereince and help users to easily navigate the site while keeping it pleasing to the eye. This also comes down to visual and navigational design conventions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also got to improve on previous skills such as making a style tile and the "Think aloud test", which was similar to interviewing reserach in some ways. Having in mind that the questions shold be very precise for optimal outcome.
                <br> From previous style tiles i added some of the navigational tools from the UI kit which could later be added to the prototype.
