                Project pool 2 </h1>
            <p>
            In project pool we partnered up and could choose between different types of projects that fit our skill level. My partner and I choose to work on a DrumMachine. It worked by pressing different keys to activate buttons each with their unique drum sound.

            <p>
            The project had some advanced features that you could implement. The goals were to flash button when key was pressed, remove it again when not and being able to press the same key twice. Our drumMachine could do 2/3 perfect, it would highlight the pressed key and remove the animation again. The last addition worked in some parts, you could play the sound twice but if you'd press the key too fast it wouldn't play the second sound.

            <h2>What i've learned</h2>
            <p>
                The main goal was to learn how to add sound and improve on the use of key events. The project gave further insight into both of these. The machine is made useing key listening and removing(addEvenListner), each button having an assigned key and sound to play. I used css to add a background color of the button when it was active, basiclly killing two flies in one go, as they key would only flash when it was down.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also i learned how to add sounds in html simply by using the audio tag. I did find out that different types of sound files require their own type, we used audio/wav for mp3 files. One way I could've improved was to research some more about drum machines and if the key assigned to a sound has logic behind. I ended up assigning keys that are somewhere in the middle of they keyboard for easier use.
