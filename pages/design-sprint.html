             <p>
                Design sprint was a big group project with the goal of creating a native app concept. The subject for the app was help student life and we had total freedom in what direction we wanted to take this. We had 5 days to, map, sketch, decide, prototype and pitch our idea.
            </p>
            <p>
                During these 5 days of intense developing i had multiple responsibilities within the project. Collectively we narrowed it down to an idea of creating an app for the different student driven organizations at KEA, we called this app KEAp Up (little worldplay with KEA).

            <h2>What i've learned</h2>
            <p>
                We worked with Belbins team roles and i was the facilliator in our group, which meant i was to keep track of our time and how we spend it. This gave another aspect of working in a bigger group project and trying to organize it properly.
                <br> I also worked on our pitch. Decideing what is relevant for audience to hear and distribute subjects to group members. This was important in order not to keep repeating us self witch we later improved on in scheduled rehearsals.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this project i also had a role in prototyping our app in XD. The bottom image is showing just a part of the final high-fidelity interactive proof of concept prototype we made.
                <br> In total it helped me the importance of time keeping and organization of a group project. Haveing made all the nessecary decitions before developing is a must in order to keep the deadline.
