                This project was the last module of Basic Web. The goal was to build upon a previous website that was to be made from mobile to being responsive using principles such as media query and grids. </p>
            <p>The content was made in the previous modules of Basic Web and consisted of learning about the overall process of creating a website. This includes style tile, Gestalt laws, typography, icons, logoes etc.

            <p>
                Creating my first responsive website taught me many tools for developing not only a website but also the content for it. Some examples include: <br>
                <br> Gestalt Laws (proximity and past experience) used mainly for the navigation bar.
                <br> Color theory for picking out the complementary of blue and orange, used in the website but mostly the connected moodboard which was a new tool in itself.
                <br> Desktop reserach for acquiring the knowledge to write the content.
                <br> The use of grids. Before grids it was quite the challenge to positing content on the page without positioning everything manually.
                <br> Media querys which helps setup the page and break it into different breakpoints. These breakpoints allow me to structure how the pages look according to the viweport. The responsive website has a breakpoint for users, regarding if they're looking at it from a mobile, tablet or desktop point of view.
