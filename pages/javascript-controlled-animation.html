                Javascript controlled animation </h1>
            <p>
            The assignment was simply to make 10 different css animations for my character to be turned on and off by clicking a button. It should also have a sound devoted to helping the user better understand the application.
            </p>
            <p>
            I used my previous made leaf character and by conjoining javascript and css made him spin, skew, strech etc. by the use of functions in buttons made as constants. The sound added was a simple click sound to enhance the feeling of pressing the buttons.

            <h2>What i've learned</h2>
            <p>
                Basic javascript knowledge has been the main takeout from this project. Getting to know the language, the use of constants and variables, querySelector and functions has shown just a tiny bit of how versatile and usefull javascript is.
            </p>
            <p>
                To make these buttons work theres also been css involved. The use of keyframes was the main part used, mostly with transform in addition, wether it'd be to scale, rotate, or translate the SVG. And it should be a SVG to optimice posibilities.
